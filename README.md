# Trello Colors

We use labels extensively, but those little lines are hard to distinguish.
This project is to make it so that you can see all the labels on a trello board at a glance.

Currently the style makes each label a full width bar on the card.

You can then either add the css to your user styles in chrome, or using stylish in firefox.

As of March 15, 2013 this style displays correctly.
